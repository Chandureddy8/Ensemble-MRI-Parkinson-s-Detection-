Parkinson's disease (PD) belongs to a group of conditions called motor system disorders, which cause unintended or uncontrollable movements of the body.  The precise cause of PD is unknown, but some cases are hereditary while others are thought to occur from a combination of genetics and environmental factors that trigger the disease.  In PD, brain cells become damaged or die in the part of the brain that produces dopamine--a chemical needed to produce smooth, purposeful movement.

The four primary symptoms of PD are:

tremor--shaking that has a characteristic rhythmic back and forth motion
rigidity--muscle stiffness or a resistance to movement, where muscles remain constantly tense and contracted
bradykinesia--slowing of spontaneous and automatic movement that can make it difficult to perform simple tasks or rapidly perform routine movements
postural instability--impaired balance and changes in posture that can increase the risk of falls.
Other symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, chewing, or speaking; emotional changes; urinary problems or constipation; dementia or other cognitive problems; fatigue; and problems sleeping.

PD usually affects people around the age of 70 years but can occur earlier.  Women are more affected by PD.  Currently there are no specific tests that diagnose sporadic PD.
